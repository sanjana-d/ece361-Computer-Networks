The execution command should have the following structure:  
deliver <server address> <server port number>  
Upon  execution,  the  client  program  should  read  data  from  a  file  specified  by  the  user, 
construct  struct packets,  and  send  the  packets  to  the  server  using  a  UDP  socket.  If  a 
file is larger than 1000 bytes, it needs to be fragmented into multiple packets with maximum 
size 1000 before transmission. 
 
You should test your code with large files (you can try putting them in the tmp/ directory on 
the  UG  machines;  we  have  heard  this  does  not  affect  your  disk  quota).  You  can  use  the 
following command to create a large file (change the ??5M?? at the end to suit your needs):  dd if=/dev/zero of=./test.file bs=4k iflag=fullblock,count_bytes count=5M
