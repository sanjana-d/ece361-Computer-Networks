Topic: Does the history of science tell us that there can be no general scientific method?
Thesis
The history of science sheds light on the numerous scientific methods that have led to heated debates on what factors define a set way of doing science, if any. For countless centuries, science has been conducted in various ways using numerous scientific methods. Many of these scientific methods have been challenged, and major problems have been discovered with some methods. This portrays that there is no one way of going about science. Therefore, it would be incorrect to state that a ??general scientific method?? exists.
Abstract
Throughout history we have seen many different takes on what the scientific method should be. For instance, the empiricist perspective states that science is an empirically guided activity. Another perspective, falsificationism, states that science is a theoretically guided activity. On the other hand, historicism says that science is guided by social norms that evolve as a result of the changes in time. The differences in views clearly depict that a single scientific method does not exist, and has been a longstanding question in the history of science. This paper aims to eradicate all misconceptions and preconceived notions that assert the existence of a ??general scientific method??. It will highlight the empiricist way of thinking and its three distinctions which include semantic, epistemic, and modal, while addressing the issues the epistemic aspect raises. It will also reflect on Karl Popper??s falsification theory that involves the concept of refutation, and the associated problems with it. Lastly, Thomas Kuhn??s stages of scientific change will be discussed, considering both advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, this paper aims to display that science cannot be reported/conducted in a concrete way, nor can it be applied to all situations and problems in the same manner. Therefore, a singular scientific method is nothing more than a fallacy.
Context of thesis
The existence of whether science is done in one set way is a debate that stands to this day. There are several different views that one may take which include but are not limited to being an empiricist, falsificist, and historicist. All these scientific methods lay out a specific way of doing science where some are more complex and involve more steps like Thomas Kuhn's stages of science change while others focus on a more central idea such as Karl Popper's falsification theory. This shows that throughout history and even to this day many people may not agree with the claim that there is no set scientific method. 
Extended Outline
Introduction
What is a scientific method - describe it?
Give specific examples of scientific methods used in the past
Empiricism, Kuhns Method, Poppers Method, Realism, Holism (last two maybe)
State thesis
Main Body (Split into three paragraphs)
Empiricism:
Talk about the empiricist way of thinking and give some background on it (from lecture notes)
Then talk about the problem faced with empiricism which speaks on how knowledge is gained and if it depends on experiences [1]
Falsification
Talk about Poppers method of falsification and give examples/background on it. Maybe even talk about how ad hoc explanations were added to theories just to make them true - which led to the idea of falsification. 
Then talk about the problem with falsification and how ad hoc explanations are not always wrong and this was seen with the Newtonian example that Popper used to prove his theory, but the ad hoc explanation provided was confirmed[2]. Can also talk about the problem with Kuhn??s definition of a paradigm and rationality. 
Historicism
Talk about Kuhn's stages of scientific change and state the stages involved and give a little background on each. Maybe put some emphasis on paradigms and how two paradigms cannot be compared on an apples to apples basis due to change in standards, etc. (from lecture notes)
Then talk about the problem that this scientific method faces which involves it not being able to account for other scientific advancements that are seen outside the specific paradigm that we operate in, and it not being able to be applied for every field (i.e. biology too, not only physics - give an example of this)[3].
Conclusion
Restate thesis
Summarize argument of there not existing a general scientific method
Briefly reiterate the three theories (empiricism, falsification, and historicism) and the problems with them 
Talk about how science today is more about fallibility (maybe give an example)

This chapter of The Problem of Empiricism and the Concept of Meaning talks about the different ways that the problem of empiricism can be viewed. Specifically it talks about the epistemological and methodological problems. This is relevant to my essay as it allows one to see how the empiricist way of thinking is faulty and does not always work. This is mentioned in the main body of my essay (in the outline section of this draft).

This article talks about the fact there is no set scientific method as in today's day science is more dependent on it fallibility. It talks about the many scientific methods employed through the history of science and breaks them down to see the core reason they do not work. This is relevant to my essay as in the article the author talks about Poppers method of falsification and how Popper comes to the realization that his theory is not exactly correct.

This article points out the limitations that are seen in Kuhn's stages of scientific change such as its lack of being able to account for historical advancements outside of the specific paradigm. This is relevant to my paper because it helps see the many downfalls of Kuhn's theory which at first may seem right, but in reality does not work well. This is mentioned in the main body of my essay (in the outline section of this draft).

This discusses several different problems with Kuhn's stages of scientific change such as the problem with paradigms, revolutions, and rationality. This is relevant to my essay as it allows me to show yet another problem with Kuhn's stages, and thus it is not a scientific method. This is mentioned in the main body of my essay (in the outline section of this draft).

This chapter of The Problem of Empiricism and the Concept of Meaning talks about the different ways that the problem of empiricism can be viewed. Specifically it talks about the epistemological and methodological problems. This is relevant to my essay as it allows one to see how the empiricist way of thinking is faulty and does not always work. This is mentioned in the main body of my essay (in the outline section of this draft).

This article talks about the fact there is no set scientific method as in today's day science is more dependent on it fallibility. It talks about the many scientific methods employed through the history of science and breaks them down to see the core reason they do not work. This is relevant to my essay as in the article the author talks about Poppers method of falsification and how Popper comes to the realization that his theory is not exactly correct.

This article points out the limitations that are seen in Kuhn's stages of scientific change such as its lack of being able to account for historical advancements outside of the specific paradigm. This is relevant to my paper because it helps see the many downfalls of Kuhn's theory which at first may seem right, but in reality does not work well. This is mentioned in the main body of my essay (in the outline section of this draft).

This discusses several different problems with Kuhn's stages of scientific change such as the problem with paradigms, revolutions, and rationality. This is relevant to my essay as it allows me to show yet another problem with Kuhn's stages, and thus it is not a scientific method. This is mentioned in the main body of my essay (in the outline section of this draft).

Topic: Does the history of science tell us that there can be no general scientific method?

Thesis
The history of science sheds light on the numerous scientific methods that have led to heated debates on what factors define a set way of doing science, if any. For countless centuries, science has been conducted in various ways using numerous scientific methods. Many of these scientific methods have been challenged, and major problems have been discovered with some methods. This portrays that there is no one way of going about science. Therefore, it would be incorrect to state that a ??general scientific method?? exists.

Abstract
Throughout history we have seen many different takes on what the scientific method should be. For instance, the empiricist perspective states that science is an empirically guided activity. Another perspective, falsificationism, states that science is a theoretically guided activity. On the other hand, historicism says that science is guided by social norms that evolve as a result of the changes in time. The differences in views clearly depict that a single scientific method does not exist, and has been a longstanding question in the history of science. This paper aims to eradicate all misconceptions and preconceived notions that assert the existence of a ??general scientific method??. It will highlight the empiricist way of thinking and its three distinctions which include semantic, epistemic, and modal, while addressing the issues the epistemic aspect raises. It will also reflect on Karl Popper??s falsification theory that involves the concept of refutation, and the associated problems with it. Lastly, Thomas Kuhn??s stages of scientific change will be discussed, considering both advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, this paper aims to display that science cannot be reported/conducted in a concrete way, nor can it be applied to all situations and problems in the same manner. Therefore, a singular scientific method is nothing more than a fallacy. 

Context of thesis
The existence of whether science is done in one set way is a debate that stands to this day. There are several different views that one may take which include but are not limited to being an empiricist, falsificist, and historicist. All these scientific methods lay out a specific way of doing science where some are more complex and involve more steps like Thomas Kuhn's stages of science change while others focus on a more central idea such as Karl Popper's falsification theory. This shows that throughout history and even to this day many people may not agree with the claim that there is no set scientific method.

Extended Outline
Introduction
What is a scientific method - describe it?
Give specific examples of scientific methods used in the past
Empiricism, Kuhns Method, Poppers Method, Realism, Holism (last two maybe)
State thesis
Main Body (Split into three paragraphs)
Empiricism:
Talk about the empiricist way of thinking and give some background on it (from lecture notes)
Then talk about the problem faced with empiricism which speaks on how knowledge is gained and if it depends on experiences [1]
Falsification
Talk about Poppers method of falsification and give examples/background on it. Maybe even talk about how ad hoc explanations were added to theories just to make them true - which led to the idea of falsification. 
Then talk about the problem with falsification and how ad hoc explanations are not always wrong and this was seen with the Newtonian example that Popper used to prove his theory, but the ad hoc explanation provided was confirmed[2]. Can also talk about the problem with Kuhn??s definition of a paradigm and rationality. 
Historicism
Talk about Kuhn's stages of scientific change and state the stages involved and give a little background on each. Maybe put some emphasis on paradigms and how two paradigms cannot be compared on an apples to apples basis due to change in standards, etc. (from lecture notes)
Then talk about the problem that this scientific method faces which involves it not being able to account for other scientific advancements that are seen outside the specific paradigm that we operate in, and it not being able to be applied for every field (i.e. biology too, not only physics - give an example of this)[3].
Conclusion
Restate thesis
Summarize argument of there not existing a general scientific method
Briefly reiterate the three theories (empiricism, falsification, and historicism) and the problems with them 
Talk about how science today is more about fallibility (maybe give an example)
