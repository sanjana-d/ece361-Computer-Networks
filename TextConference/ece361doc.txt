1. Private Messaging


Description:
We decided to implement private messaging where 1 client can send a private message to another client regardless of what session are they in/not in as long as both are logged into the server database. In command line to initiate this feature, the client must type:
        pm <username they’d like to message> [space] <text>


Implementation:
The client code will send this information to the server. 
The server first looks for the destination user in the database
* Then checks if that user is logged in
   * If they are logged in, the server will send the private message to that destination client
   * Then the server will also PM_ACK the original client to ensure them that the private message was sent
* If the destination user is not logged in
   * Then the server sends a PM_NAK to the original client because they are unable to send the private message




Additions:
We added new packet types like PM, PM_ACK, PM_NAK.

2. Invite


Description: 
The second feature that was implemented for this section was invite. Invite essentially allows a user to invite another active user into the session where they currently belong. In the command line to initiate this feature, the client must type:
 invite <username of user they’d like to invite>


Implementation:
Once the above command is typed, the client code will take this information then serialize the information and get it ready to send to the server.
The server then receives this information, deserializes it and uses it to make several checks before sending the user this invite. 
Checks made by server:
* Check if inviting user is in a session (if not in session, NAK sent to client)
* Check if invited user is logged in (if not logged in, NAK sent to client)
* Check if the invited user is already in a session (if in session, NAK sent to client)        


If all the above checks are successfully passed, then the server sends the invited client a message about this invitation.
The invited client then prints a message on terminal to allow the invited client to either reject or accept the invite. Once the decision is made a packet is sent with the decision to the server.
Upon receiving the decision the server looks at the response, and sends the inviting client an ACK or NAK based on if the invite was accepted or declined, respectively. 
 
        
Additions:
We added new packet types like INVITE, INV_ACK, INV_NAK.
